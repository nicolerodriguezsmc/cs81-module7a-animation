The following are my reflections:
* What part of the code was most confusing and why?
  Luckily, this code wasn't too confusing. I think figuring out setInterval and how the 500 millisecond parameter worked confused me the most. Plus, it was initially confusing why 
  it was necessary to use clearInterval when we're already counting loops.
  
* How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
  The animation shows how JavaScript can do things over time without freezing the page. setInterval updates the emojis every half second, but the page can still function.
  
* What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
  I made the background change colors. It turns red for the first half, yellow for the second half, and green when done. You can track progress kind of like a reverse traffic light.
